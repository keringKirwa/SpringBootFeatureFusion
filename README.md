# Spring Boot M-Pesa Integration and Payment

This repository showcases a Spring Boot application that incorporates various features including M-Pesa integration and payment, Callable interface for multithreading, Java Streams, exception handling, standard response formats, database one-to-many relationships, and JWT authentication.

## Features

### 1. M-Pesa Integration and Payment

The application integrates with the M-Pesa API to facilitate payment transactions. It includes examples of various M-Pesa functionalities such as C2B (Customer to Business), B2C (Business to Customer), STK (Push), and transaction reversal.

### 2. Callable Interface for Multithreading

Multithreading is implemented using the `Callable` interface to perform asynchronous tasks. This enhances the application's performance by parallelizing certain operations.

### 3. Java Streams

Java Streams are utilized for efficient and concise processing of data. Stream operations are applied for filtering, mapping, and transforming data, providing a functional programming approach.

### 4. Exception Handling and Standard Response Formats

The application employs a robust exception handling mechanism to gracefully handle errors. Responses follow a standardized format to convey success, error, or validation information consistently.

### 5. Database One-to-Many Relationships

The data model includes one-to-many relationships between entities, demonstrating the management of related data in a relational database.

### 6. JWT Authentication

JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is implemented for securing API endpoints. Users are authenticated and authorized using JWT tokens.
